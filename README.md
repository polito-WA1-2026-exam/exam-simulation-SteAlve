- Route `/something/:param`: page content and purpose, param specification
- ...

## API Server

  - Body: `{ email, password }`
  - Response: `{ userId, name, surname, email, planType }`

- `GET /api/sessions/current`
  - Response: `{ userId, name, surname, email, planType }` or 401

- `DELETE /api/sessions/current`
  - Response: empty

### Courses

- `GET /api/courses`
  - Response: array of `{ courseCode, name, credits, maxStudents, enrolledCount, preparatoryCourse, incompatibilities[] }`

### Study Plan

- `GET /api/studyplan`
  - Response: `{ type, courses[] }` or 404 if no plan exists

- `POST /api/studyplan`
  - Creates empty plan for the first time
  - Body: `{ type }`
  - Response: `{ type, courses: [] }` or 409 if plan already exists

- `PUT /api/studyplan`
  - Saves (replaces) the study plan with courses
  - Body: `{ type, courseCodes[] }`
  - Validates credit range and all constraints
  - Response: `{ type, courses[] }` or 422 with error message

## Data Models

- `dao-users.js`
  - `getUser(email, password)`: verifies credentials, returns user object or false
  - `getUserById(id)`: re-hydrates user from session

- `dao-courses.js`
  - `getCourses()`: all courses with enrolledCount and incompatibilities array
  - `getStudyPlan(userId)`: courses in the user's plan
  - `createStudyPlan(userId, type)`: sets planType, no courses (first-time creation)
  - `saveStudyPlan(userId, planType, courseCodes)`: atomic replace of plan
  - `deleteStudyPlan(userId)`: deletes plan and resets planType to null

## Database Tables

- Table `users` - contains user credentials: userId (PK), name, surname, email, hashedPassword, salt, planType ('full-time' or 'part-time')
- Table `courses` - contains course data: courseCode (PK), name, credits, optional maxStudents, optional preparatoryCourse (FK to it-self)
- Table `incompatibilities` - contains mutually exclusive course pairs: (courseCode1, courseCode2) (composite PK, FK to courses)
- Table `study_plan_courses` - pivot table linking students to their chosen courses: (userId (FK to users), courseCode (FK to courses)) (composite PK)

## Main React Components

- `App` (in `App.jsx`)
  - Root component, handles routing
  - Holds global state: logged-in user, full course list, study plan
  - Fetches courses on mount, study plan on login

- `Navbar` (in `components/Navbar.jsx`)
  - Top navigation bar
  - Shows login button when anonymous, user name and logout button when authenticated

- `LoginForm` (in `components/LoginForm.jsx`)
  - Email and password form
  - Calls POST /api/sessions, redirects to `/` on success

- `CourseList` (in `components/CourseList.jsx`)
  - Renders full course list in alphabetical order
  - Passes edit-mode context down to each row

- `CourseRow` (in `components/CourseRow.jsx`)
  - Single expandable course row
  - Expanded view shows incompatible courses and preparatory course
  - In edit mode: shows add button, or reason why course cannot be added

- `StudyPlan` (in `components/StudyPlan.jsx`)
  - Study plan panel shown when logged in
  - Type selector (full-time / part-time) when creating a new plan
  - Credit counter with min/max range
  - Save, Cancel and Delete buttons

- `StudyPlanRow` (in `components/StudyPlanRow.jsx`)
  - Single course row inside the study plan
  - Remove button with reason message if removal is blocked by a preparatory constraint
